reconsider module environments (add basic lua functions to all environments) x
remove or fix console
finish options/settings window and move all the stuff into zk settings
(epic menu options maybe for player stuff)

continue gui and io implementation:
- implement saving via gui X
- implement adding emitters via gui X
- implement loading sounds (file browser?) x
- implement localizing sounds, if possible
- implement getting track length from files, if possible
- improve main window: add tabs for emitters, global, possibly instances
- consider creating $map.sdd folder and subfolders
- also consider/test if installing the editor into spring/luaui would be possible
- consider more chili subclasses for shared functions (mouseover for layout, ..)

player implementation:
- consider player module
- alternativly, make player widget

emitter script implementation:
- use loadstring for basic scripts
- consider how callins are to be implemented
- consider external scripts
- consider how functions are to be written to files(savetable may have problems with this)
