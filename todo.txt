reconsider module environments (add basic lua functions to all environments)
remove or fix console
finish options/settings window

continue gui and io implementation:
- implement saving via gui
- implement adding emitters via gui
- implement loading sounds (file browser?)
- implement localizing sounds, if possible
- implement getting track length from files, if possible
- improve main window: add tabs for emitters, global, possibly instances

player implementation:
- consider player module
- alternativly, make player widget

emitter script implementation:
- use loadstring for basic scripts
- consider how callins are to be implemented
- consider external scripts
- consider how functions are to be written to files(savetable may have problems with this)

i love you.
