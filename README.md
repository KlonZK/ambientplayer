APE Ambient Sound Player and Editor

An ingame editor widget to create a sound scenery for your map, including positional audio and plug-in of external lua scripts.

install into your spring/Luaui folder. make sure you run the game with the --write-dir set to your spring folder.
after you started the game, set up a working directory for your map (the widget will create or use a regular map folder structure. you can use an .sdd map archive as your working directory, or you can add your working directory to your map archive later.)

requires spring engine version 100.+(currently the dev-test version), the 100.0 release will not allow you to save your map config properly.
